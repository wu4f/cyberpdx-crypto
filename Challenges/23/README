# Step 0: Install scala-2.13.1 from deb to get java as well
#   run the scala domMessage $PASSWORD < graphInput.txt command to produce
#   arr${i} output before going to Step 1

# This is a custom level generated manually
#  23_part1.sh -> manual edit of arr -> 23_part2.sh -> yEd on graphml images
#    -> splice to final
#Step 1:
#  Create the graph manually (using yEd for example)
#  Save the public key version as MessageBlank.graphml
#    It will need to have each node labelled as N0, N1, ... N#
#  Enter in the graph into simple text format... see an example for illustration.
#    Call it graphInput.txt
#
#Step 2:
#  Modify 23_part1.sh to use the password you want.
#
#Step 3:
#  Edit the 23_part2.sh program to use the Enc output from the worksheet in
#    23_part1_output.txt.
#  Remember to change the length in for loop to match message length
#  (A bit of a pain but not too bad)  Could be made cleaner.
#  This should mostly do it.
