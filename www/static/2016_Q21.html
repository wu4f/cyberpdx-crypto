<h3>Q21 Student Feedback "My favorite thing about this camp was..."</h3>
<ul>
<li> "Learning knowledge that I did not even know exist, and being able to apply it in the real world. Not just on electronics, but the hard work, and mental state of mind that is evolved in cybersecurity. Thinking outside the box, and looking in a different lens.
<li> "The teachers, students and friends that were willing to help each other."
<li> "The video making. I love making fun storyboards, and the best part about the video making was the editing."
<li> "Doing all the activities because it brought out the teams strengths and weaknesses."
<li> "Learning about ways to protect myself and others on the Internet."
<li> "The summit debate."
<li> "The opportunity to learn about a wide variety of topics. The teachers were excellent at engaging us learners and making us feel comfortable. The entire camp was an extremely enjoyable experience and I am definitely very glad I attended."
<li> "I really enjoyed the activity where we helped Four" (a character in Divergent)
<li> "I liked the crypto challenges a lot because it was really satisfying to figure out the hidden codes, I thought the programming was fun (especially the turtle art project), and I thought that the film element was also interesting and it enabled us to be creative!"
<li> "Solving the crypto challenges. I thought that it was extremely well put together and was equally challenging and fun, and everyone on our team worked very well together and were able to bounce ideas off of each other to solve them. The problem-solving and creativity part of this thread is something that everyone on our team enjoyed and appreciated."
<li> "I really enjoyed the programming aspect. Especially the final art piece and finding passwords for websites."
<li> "Programming with python and using encryption in programming"
</ul>

<h3>Q21 Teacher Feedback "My favorite thing about this camp was..."</h3>
<ul>
<li> "The challenge but success within the cryptography strand. The interconnectedness built into the progressive challenges was superbly handled, and the scavenger hunt was phenomenal! Most of the programming was awesome too. The art project was especially fantastic! So inspiring for the students. And the integration of movie-making was such a great bonus! At least one of my students chose to accept her position on the team for that reason alone, and she's loved the rest now too. So fun to teach basic techniques and use it to bring together other camp material."

<li> "The integration of cybersecurity with cryptography, programming, and moral/ethical aspects."

<li> "Differentiation/attention given to visual learners and beginners in the programming segments was great to see. The clarity and presentation style of the Crypto sections were exceptional."

<li> "Observing the students work as a team and motivate each other to learn. Also, just personally interesting!"

<li> "The summit activities and scavenger hunt were well planned and implemented. My students were able to apply their knowledge and have fun."

<li> "Encouraged collaboration, variety of exposure (four threads), emphasis on filmmaking, office hours kept for assistance at night, real life summit emulation, FREE camp!!"

<li> "Not only is this simulation (CyberSummit) highly effective, it is one of the more highly talked about activities among teams."
