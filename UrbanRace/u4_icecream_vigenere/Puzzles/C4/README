Step 1:
  Create the graph manually (using yEd for example)
  Save the public key version as MessageBlank.graphml
    It will need to have each node labelled as N0, N1, ... N#
  Enter in the graph into simple text format... see an example for illustration.
    Call it graphInput.txt

Step 2:
  Modify the run.sh to use the password you want.

Step 3:
  Edit the replace.sh program to use the Enc output from the worksheet.
  (A bit of a pain but not too bad)  Could be made cleaner.
  This should mostly do it.

Step 4:
  yEd
